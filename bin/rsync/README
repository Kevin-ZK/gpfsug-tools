rsync-3.0.9-patched/
  - patched version of the 3.0.9 release of rsync, with rudimentary GPFS NFSv4 ACL copying support 
  - GPFS posix acl support ought to work fine in native rsync, this patch is just for GPFS NFSv4 support
  - rsync 3.0.9 source can be obtained from: 
     http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-3.0.9.tar.gz
  - the patch is: 
     gpfs_support_rsync-3.0.9.patch 
    which adds rudimentary NFSv4 ACL copying support to rsync - the code for which comes from here:
     http://lists.samba.org/archive/rsync/2008-October/021963.html
  - Prerequisite is, at least, libacl development headers - in Ubuntu 12.04, this can be obtained with (for example):
     sudo apt-get install libacl1-dev 
  - Once you've applied the patch with, say: 
     patch patch -p1 -i ../gpfs_support_rsync-3.0.9.patch
    configure rsync with:
     ./configure --enable-acl-support --enable-xattr-support --enable-gpfs-support --prefix=/opt/rsync.gpfs
    then do:
     make
    and, optionally,:
     make install
  - to use the gpfs extensions, add the rsync command option:
    --gpfs-attrs
  - there's also --gpfs-cache-attr


 - So, step by step (this is from an Ubuntu 12.04 box), to build this do:
# sudo apt-get install libacl1-dev
# mkdir -p src/rsync
# cd src/rsync
# wget http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-3.0.9.tar.gz
### Get the gpfs_support_rsync-3.0.9.patch file and put it in this folder (src/rsync)
# tar -zxf rsync-3.0.9.tar.gz
# cd rsync-3.0.9
# patch -p1 -i ../gpfs_support_rsync-3.0.9.patch
# ./configure --enable-acl-support --enable-xattr-support --enable-gpfs-support --prefix=/opt/rsync.gpfs
# make 
# make install


 - To check that the binary has gpfs support, check that the "gpfs" capability is present in:
# /opt/rsync.gpfs/bin/rsync --version

# Troubleshooting:

Did not work:
/opt/rsync.gpfs/bin/rsync -avzh  --progress --gpfs-attrs --gpfs-timepreserve --rsync-path=/opt/rsync.gpfs/bin/rsync /gpfs1/dir $remoteip:/gpfs1/dir
sending incremental file list
File-list index 0 not in 0 - -1 (read_ndx_and_attrs) [receiver]
rsync error: protocol incompatibility (code 2) at rsync.c(710) [receiver=3.1.0dev]
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (9 bytes received so far) [sender]
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(608) [sender=3.1.0dev]

Does work!
/opt/rsync.gpfs/bin/rsync -avzh --progress  --gpfs-attrs --gpfs-timepreserve --rsync-path='/opt/rsync.gpfs/bin/rsync --gpfs-attrs  --gpfs-timepreserve --progress' /gpfs1/dir $remoteip:/gpfs1/dir
