Couple of scripts here.

mkfileset:

	Creates a fileset (currently in a filesystem called NOC) hanging off the
    root of the filesystem. 
	The clever bit (if there is one) is that it fudges mmedquota to allow you
    to set a fileset  quota without going into vi
	
	Syntax is mkfileset filesetname size(GB) path description"

	Where: path is the subpath for the fileset - ie for /NOC/TEST path would
    be TEST.


gpfsdf:
	lists all filesets on a filesystem (currently hard coded to NOC) together 
    with their quotas and useage.
